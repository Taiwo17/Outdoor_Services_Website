          <OurStory
            paraOne={`At Schadtle, we take a holistic approach to landscaping. We believe that creating beautiful outdoor spaces is about more than just planting flowers or laying down turf. Our team of experts takes into account the entire environment, from the soil composition to the available sunlight, to create a landscape that is not only beautiful, but also sustainable and functional.`}
            paraTwo={`One of our main priorities is to design and build outdoor spaces that are eco-friendly and beneficial to the environment. This means using locally sourced materials whenever possible, and implementing practices that conserve water and reduce waste. We also make a point to select plants that are well-suited to the local climate and require minimal maintenance.`}
            paraThree={`Another key aspect of our approach is our commitment to exceptional customer service. We work closely with our clients to understand their needs and desires, and to develop a custom plan that will transform their outdoor space into a place of beauty and relaxation. We pride ourselves on our open communication and transparency throughout the process, so that our clients are always in the loop and feel confident in the work we are doing.
            `}
            paraFour={`Finally, we believe that outdoor spaces should be enjoyed to their fullest extent, and we design our landscapes with this in mind. We create spaces that are not only visually stunning, but also functional and practical for outdoor activities, whether that means adding a custom outdoor fireplace, a patio for dining and entertaining, or a retaining wall to create more usable space. With our approach to landscaping, we strive to create outdoor spaces that are both beautiful and sustainable, and that bring joy to our clients for years to come.`}
